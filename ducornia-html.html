  <h2> This is an wikipedia of an imaginary animal </h2>
  <h3> It's all for fun yay! </h3>
  <p> Ducornias are cetaceans (aquatic mammals), they are the evolutionary form of vaquita. </p>

  <p>At the brink of extinction, throughout time, vaquita have evolve and this benefit them to adapt to the environment that had been dominated by human activities. Even after their evolution, their behaviour didn’t change drastically. 
Ducornias currently still live in upper Gulf of California, their home clean and healthy. They tend to travel in groups of 4 or more to defend themselves from predators (e.g sharks and other whales) and to protect their offsprings. When travelling in groups, they are less prone to being caught in gillnet or attack by predators. This increases their chance of survival and can help them make quick recovery in population.</p>

  <h3><i> The History of a Vaquita</i> </h3>
  <p>The ancestor of ducornia, vaquita, have been in danger ever since human start hunting illegally. In the place where they live, there is a popular fish called the totoaba where they are being illegally sold to China at high prices. The totaba is very valuable because their swim bladders are used in China for medical purpose. To catch these species, fisherman uses gillnets and this net would tangle any species that cross their path. This is no exception for vaquita as well, since they have similar size compare to totaba (“About the Species”). Due to the decline of vaquita population, the Mexico’s government decided to ban totoaba fishing in 1993 and banning most gillnets. However, this doesn’t stop the fishermen from hunting illegally. They would hid the gillnets aways and use it when the fishing season is near. Fishermen would take advantage of this since they could sell the fish from $3,000 to $10,000 per kilogram (Albeck). The gillnets is one of the threats that ducornia’s ancestor have to face. They can also be capture in commercial shrimp trawls. Even their habitat is a danger zone because of their predators; however, it can also be due to the damming of the Colorado river leaving them less freshwater in their habitat. In additional, due to the coastal development, lack of genetic variability, pollution, and pesticides increasing there (“Natural History”), the vaquita ecosystem can be unstable. Some coastal development may include the increase of factories, garbage lands, agricultural chemicals, and oil spills and those factor can cause harm in the ocean (Madison, et). There have been organizations throughout time to save the vaquitas. They were able to convince the government how important the species is. This led to them conserving the species in a place they can safely breed. It took many years until the organization were able to reach to raise 1000 vaquitas. They had to let the go since there isn’t enough money to raise more. The vaquitas were on their own yet they were able to survive pass extinction.  </p>

   <h3> <b> After Evolution Features </b> </h3>
    <ol>
      <li> Sharp Fins </li>
    -The sharp fins is use to cut away the gillnets when they are accidentally caught when people are hunting illegally.
     <li>Sharp Teeth </li>
    -The sharp teeth is use for breaking down their prey and this can also be a defense when they are being attacked by predators.
      <li>Two Horns</li>
    -The two horns is use to scare or threaten their predator, it will make them look formidable and make predator less likely to attack when the ducornia are travelling in a group.
     <li> Black, Dark Blue skin color</li>
    -The black and dark blue skin can help them blend into the deep sea and swim away when they sense a predator nearby.
     <li> Thick skull</li>
     -The thick skull is use to protect their head, since they have horns, the thick skull protect their head from being impaled by the pressure of their horn.
     <li> Blowhole</li>
     The blowhole is use to breathe fresh air, they come up from the deep sea and breathe fresh air and then return to the deep sea once again.</ol>
