   <h3>List of anime that I've enjoyed watching</h3>
   <ol>
       <li class="grey-text"> Kimetsu No Yaiba </li>
       <p>Why? Because both the plot and artwork is amazing and stunning to begin with. There are many scenes where it'll make you cry.</p>
  
        <li class="red-text"> Inuyasha </li>
        <p>Although the artwork is kinda old, it's still nice to see the plot.</p>
   </ol>
